//
//READ-ONLY IN FOUR WAYS, not one. The content is not editable; the cursor is
//hidden so it does not invite one; the active-line highlight is off for the same
//reason; and the syntax worker is never started. Nothing here is a place to
//write code, and it should not look like one for even a moment.
//
//A PLUGIN OF ITS OWN, WITH ITS OWN VENDOR FOLDER. Ace is 900KB and belongs to
//exactly one concern. Putting it in the shared vendors folder would make it look
//like something the app needs, when what the app needs is "show me this text so
//it can be read" — and that is what this provides. Swap this plugin and the
//panes do not change.
//
//IT KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE THEME, deliberately. The theme consumes this, not
//the other way round: every pane consumes the theme, so a theme that this
//consumed back would be a cycle. Same shape as the guard hook.
