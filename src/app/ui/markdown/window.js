//it does not sanitise, and the safety of every use of it depends on the frame
//built here rather than on the caller remembering.
//
//IT PROVIDES THE FRAME AND NOTHING ELSE. The Rendered/Source toggle that sits
//around it is the theme's, because the buttons are; this owns the one part that
//must not be got wrong. Panes see neither — they ask the theme for <Markdown>
//and get something that is safe by construction.

    //A PULL REQUEST BODY IS MARKDOWN THAT GITHUB WILL RENDER, so a preview of it
    //that is not rendered is a preview of the wrong thing. As source it is a wall
    //of pipes and hashes, and the one thing it was formatted for is the thing that
    //does not happen.
    //
    //IN AN IFRAME, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN rather than a convenience for
    //styling. This text came off a machine running a script somebody wrote, so it
    //is exactly as trustworthy as that script — and markdown carries raw HTML
    //through BY DESIGN, which `marked` does not sanitise and has never claimed to.
    //Put in this document it would be running inside a page that has node behind it.
    //
    //So it renders into a frame that can do nothing:
    //
    //  no allow-scripts   a <script> or an onerror in the markdown never runs. This
    //                     is the load-bearing one, and both halves are measured in
    //                     the Kit pane rather than assumed.
    //  a CSP too          default-src 'none', so a remote <img> cannot phone home —
    //                     which would otherwise turn "somebody opened this" into a
    //                     request to a host of the author's choosing.
    //  srcdoc             no file is written anywhere to show it.
    //
    //What it does NOT have is an opaque origin — see the note on the sandbox
    //attribute below for why, and why that is survivable here and would not be if
    //scripts could run.
    //
    //THE COST OF A REAL SANDBOX is that this side cannot measure the frame to size
    //it, because reading contentDocument needs allow-same-origin. So it takes a
    //height and scrolls inside, which is what these panels do anyway.

        //`default-src 'none'` is not only about images. Every fetch directive falls
        //back to it, `script-src` included — so a <script> in the markdown has no
        //source it is allowed to execute from, and an inline `onerror=` needs
        //`script-src 'unsafe-inline'`, which is not granted either. The policy
        //refuses the code; the sandbox was refusing it a second time.
        //
        //WHICH IS WHY THE SANDBOX COULD GO. It was not free: `sandbox=""` renders
        //NOTHING in this NW.js build, silently — an empty box the size you asked
        //for, which reads as "there was nothing to show". Measured in the Kit pane,
        //five ways: plain srcdoc renders; adding sandbox="" blanks it; adding the
        //CSP as well blanks it; a data: URL instead blanks it; only
        //sandbox="allow-same-origin" rendered. So the choice was never
        //"sandbox or not" — it was which single restriction to keep.

        //machine running a script somebody wrote, and markdown carries raw HTML
        //through BY DESIGN — `marked` does not sanitise and has never claimed to.

        //text they would overwrite written beside them. If the policy ever stops
        //holding, that exhibit says so on sight instead of a comment here claiming
        //it still does.
        //WIDTH AND BORDER ARE NOT DECORATION HERE. An iframe with nothing said
        //about it is 300px wide with a inset border, whatever box it is in --
        //so a rendered document came out as a narrow column with a frame drawn
        //round it. The plugin has to say this itself: the theme is a slot that
